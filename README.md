# tile-drag
I've always found the game UI experience on sites like chess.com or lichess.com addictive and exciting (only when I'm winning).
Part of why I love online chess is because of the movement mechanics of the pieces which makes the game feel smooth and snappy.

Knowing that not a lot of people play chess online, I wanted to create a game that mimics the "smooth and snappy" feel without having to worry about the rules of chess or blundering.

Even if you do know how to play chess, you can use this site to enchance your movement/mouse accuracy. 

Tile drag is an addictive arcade game written in vanilla javascript. Hope you enjoy!
